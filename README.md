This script is meant to be used on a clean kali linux instance, I have not tested it on an already running instance.
For a full application list check the credits.

if you are downloading the scripts seperatly, make sure to put them in the same folder.
  
# Usage
Make sure all .sh files are executable with chmod +x

sudo ./build.sh

# sip some coffee

The script installs android studio in the /opt/ folder, close android studio after installing, the script will continue after closing.

CLOSE ALL SHELLS AND WINDOWS OPENED BY THE SCRIPT BEFORE TESTING

# if after testing applications doesn't work
type: "pipx ensurepath" in a new terminal window, close afterwards, and retest.

# drozer
docker run -it fsecurelabs/drozer

# sqlitebrowser
docker run -it linuxserver/sqlitebrowser

after running the docker commands above you will be dropped into a docker container and you can run the applications normally. Check their pages for usage.

type exit, to exit the docker container.

AFTER RUNNING THIS SCRIPT NEVER CROSS THE STREAMS ANYMORE, ALL APPS WORK, SO FROM NOW ON ONLY INSTALL PIP PACKAGES WITH PIPX.

After succesfull running of the script, the android applications and RESTclient still need to be installed:
  RESTclient plugin for firefox/chrome available
